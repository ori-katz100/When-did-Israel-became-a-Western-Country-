# When did Israel became a Western country?
A culstering exercize, based on 6 variables representing different dimensions of development, in order to find out if Israel was similar to other developed countries already in the 1960's, or later. 

This project is for my book on the economic history of  Israel. I published the results in my blog:


Data files:

1. Countries - include many countries and variables for many years, mostly from https://data.worldbank.org/indicator. 
I didn't use most of the variables. 

2. Maddison - gdp per capita data from the Maddison project. 
source: https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2018

3. Country averages for each decade - created from the original Countries database, only the countries and variables used in the analysis.


Python scripts:

1. clustering countries - includes the clustering and pca plots.

2. international comparison - includes all other graphs.
