# When did Israel became a Western country
A culstering exercize: when did Israel became similar to other Western countries, according to 6 variables representing different dimensions of development. 

This project is for my book on the history of the Israeli Economy. I published the results in my blog:


Data files:
1. Countries - include many countries and variables for many years, mostly from https://data.worldbank.org/indicator. 
I didn't use most of the variables. 

2. Maddison - gdp per capita data from the Maddison project. 
source: https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2018

3. Country averages for specific decades - only the countries and variables used in the analysis.

Python scripts:

1. clustering countries - includes the clustering and pca plots.

2. international comparison - includes all other graphs.
